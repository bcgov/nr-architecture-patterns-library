If the information you are using does not exist here please review other guideline pages and/or contact the architecture team. Partnership Agreement NRM teams that work within our Development and Digital Services (DDS) branch start with a partnership agreement to ensure alignment between NRIDS and the program area. NRM Digital Service Delivery Partnership Agreement Team Agreement Before starting development, or when new team members begin contributing, ensure everyone on the team has the same understanding about coding practices, technology choices, and roles within your team. This is typically done during sprint 0. Coding Patterns and Practices Development Standards Familiarize yourself with the. These are requirements of all NRM applications. Data Guides, Standards and Resources Data is the enduring asset as part of any digital service in Government. Below are some recommended resources to get teams familiar with the data ecosystem within BC Government: Open Data Policy increases government transparency and accountability through the public release of information, including data. BC Data Catalogue is a resource for discovering thousands of datasets from across Government, and in some cases gaining access to the services themselves. Core Metadata Standard defines the metadata elements that help make digital information easier to find, to improve services, and increase government's efficiency Gender and Sex Data Standard improves how government collects and uses data to serve B.C.'s diverse population. Indigenous Languages Technology Standard: the BC Government is committed to including Indigenous languages in government records, systems and services. The BC Sans font is an open-source &quot;living&quot; typeface developed for government to improve the readability and delivery of digital services. It was designed to support special characters and syllabics found in Indigenous Languages in B.C. When designing and building your product, ensure it has the ability to collect, store, manage and display BC Sans characters. Connect with your architects for more details and references. Working with Data is a developer focused guide around developing data solutions within BC Government. Product Lifecycle Is your team replacing, re-architecting or re-platforming an existing application? If so, it's the Product Owner's responsibility to ensure the existing application is retired and the data is transitioned or preserved to ensure data quality, accuracy and currency as well as overall portfolio sustainability. Product Owners may reach out to their assigned Ministry Portfolio Manager (MPM) for assistance with the Application Retirement process. Ensure you allocate time and budget in your backlog to manage the overall lifecycle of the business processes, data and associated products. Helpful links on Application Retirement: Private Cloud The BC Government has invested heavily in the Red Hat OpenShift platform to provide self service private cloud capabilities. Training is available through the exchange lab to get teams acquainted with the platform; a good primer is here. https://developer.gov.bc.ca/ExchangeLab-Course:-OpenShift-101 The landing page for the private cloud service is here: https://cloud.gov.bc.ca/private-cloud/ Namespace provisioning can be found here: https://registry.developer.gov.bc.ca/public-landing Information on resource tuning for OpenShift Namespaces can be found here: https://beta-docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/application-resource-tuning/ The RedHat learning portal is a great resource to learn more about the platform, and they also provide a sandbox to 'learn by doing'.

QuickStart OpenShift QuickStart OpenShift Emerald Public Cloud BC Government has endorsed several public cloud services and provides quickstart guides and sample applications! https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/cloud-computing-in-the-bc-government#explore Approved AWS services can be found here: https://developer.gov.bc.ca/AWS-Services GitHub Source code should be stored in a GitHub repository in the &quot;bcgov&quot; tenancy. Access management for the bcgov GitHub tenancy can be found here: https://just-ask.developer.gov.bc.ca/ NRM specific guidance on Github is here: Source Code Repositories Authentication and Identity Most NRM digital products leverage the OCIO SSO service that is backed by Keycloak. https://bcgov.github.io/sso-requests https://oidc.gov.bc.ca/auth/ Secrets Management The platform services team operates a Vault service. It is described here: https://beta-docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/vault-secrets-management-service/ Access to the service is here: https://vault.developer.gov.bc.ca/ui/vault/auth?with=token Security and Privacy It's important that teams engage with the NRM Security and Privacy teams early and often. They can support you with general advice as well as Security Threat Risk Assessments (STRA's) and Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA's). NRM Security Knowledge Base: NRM Information Security Home NRM Privacy Knowledge Base: NRM Privacy Knowledge Base OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is another great reference for security best practices for development teams: https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/migrated_content CI/CD The deployment pipeline is a key component for your application. For visibility, collaboration and maintainability modern teams are moving away from Jenkins towards GitHub actions. It is strongly recommended that code be submitted using a Pull Request. Automated testing can and should replace manual UAT wherever practical. NRM has a modern CI/CD template using GitHub Actions and HELM: OpenShift QuickStart targeted for OpenShift Silver or Gold Cluster. NRM has a modern CI/CD template using GitHub Actions, HELM and Argo: OpenShift QuickStart Emerald targeted for OpenShift Emerald Cluster. Application Programming Interfaces (API's) We recommend adopting an &quot;API First&quot; philosophy for application development, where teams both build and consume their API's. Providing API specification with proper metadata is mandatory irrespective of the underlying implementation(REST, graphql, grpc etc..) Along with API first approach the Architecture team highly recommends looking at Domain Driven Design(DDD) where each micro-service API is bounded by its business domain(https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) Also look at Event-Driven Architecture (Event Sourcing and CQRS) when building micro-services as it promotes highly decoupled APIS, communicating over an event streaming platform (https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html, https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html) We recommend a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach to API development, as it makes the application code more reliable and efficient along with easier maintenance in the future. There are several ways to name test methods/functions but we recommend using the pattern test&lt;method_name&gt;_&lt;given_condition&gt;_&lt;expected_behavior&gt;, it makes the tests more readable, predictable and becomes living documentation of the codebase. BC Government has published a set of API Guidelines here: https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Data-and-APIs/BC-Government-API-Guidelines Information on the corporate API gateway can be found here: https://bcgov.github.io/aps-infra-platform/ Database and Data Design Most of the teams working on OpenShift are choosing a flavor of PostgreSQL to persist data for their application. Some points of consideration are: What type of data are you persisting as part of your application? Are you storing geospatial data? Audio and/or video?What are your preferred integration patterns?Do you have any requirements, for example, to replicate data to the BC Geographic Warehouse (BCGW)?What are the requirements for consistency, availability and partitioning? For NRM guidance specific to data and database design, please visit this space: NRM Data and Database Development Guidelines Database backups can be setup using the backup container image; information can be found here: https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Backup-Container Document Storage BC Government has an on premise object storage solution that delivers low cost storage for unstructured and semi-structured data. The service is billed monthly to the highwatermark of the storage your team consumes in their S3 bucket at $0.07/GB/Month. To get an S3 object storage bucket, contact the Optimize team. COMS (Common Object Management Service) is an emerging common component that leverages the object storage solution. The advantage of this component is that it includes the ability to tag and add metadata, and integrates with BC Government's standard identity providers (IDIR, BCeID). To learn more, attend the Common Services Showcase team sprint reviews or contact the team via email. An emerging companion to the Common Object Management Service being built by the Common Services team is BCBox, which is a hosted solution that uses the COMS API to allow users to upload, tag and share files using any OIDC compliant authentication mechanism. The code repository for BCBox can be found here. Design Guidance General resources for Agile designers at Digital Government (BC Visual Identity, Official BC Design System, Web Style Guide, Content Design Guidance, UX Research Guidance, Service Design Playbook) can be found here: https://digital.gov.bc.ca/resources#:~:text=Read%20the%20playbook-,For%20Designers,-B.C.%20Visual Additional design system guidance: https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Design-System/About-the-Design-System BC Parks has extended their Design Guide to include the use of the BC Sans font and other additions specific to their program: https://bcgov.github.io/bcparks/design-guides Front End Frameworks Many agile teams are using a flavor of Javascript framework for their front end development (Angular, Vue, React etc). We recommend you pick the framework that works best for the team, and if you are developing a suite of applications for your program area, harmonize across the suite where that makes sense. This will minimize risk associated with changes to the team and enable other developers to work with your code. Web Mapping Frameworks A comparison of web mapping frameworks in use in BC Government can found here: https://bcgov.github.io/bcwebmaps-options/ Back End Languages Similar to front end frameworks, we recommend you choose a development language that best suits the team and the business challenge you are working on. If you are developing a suite of applications for your program area, harmonize across the suite where that makes sense. This will minimize risk associated with changes to the team and enable other developers to work with your code. There are many languages in use by agile teams across government, the most popular being Go, Python, Java, Javascript and Typescript. The Technology Radar is a great reference to see where the momentum is around languages and frameworks.

Do I need my application and data architecture to be formally approved? A. No, there is no formal approval process for your architecture. We recommend collaborating with the architecture team during any architectural spikes or any significant architectural decisions. Our collective experience and connectedness across the community can typically provide value for the team. Q. Do I have to use OpenShift to host my application? A. No. We would generally like new applications to be running in a containerized or serverless hosting architecture. OpenShift is a strong option for teams starting out given the maturity of the platform and the surrounding community, as is the AWS Public Cloud Service, both operated by BC Government teams. Following cloud native design principles will help ensure that your application workload is portable between hosting platforms. Q. Can I pass my application off to an ops team so the team can work on new apps? A. We generally follow the &quot;you build it, you run it&quot; philosophy, and therefore recommend you build a sustainment plan into your application roadmap. Adhering as closely as possible to the 12 Factor principles is a great way to promote a sustainable, cloud native build.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Approved Hosting Options","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/nr-architecture-patterns-library/pr-preview/pr-100/docs/Application Hosting Wayfinding","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"On-Premise​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Approved Hosting Options","url":"/nr-architecture-patterns-library/pr-preview/pr-100/docs/Application Hosting Wayfinding#on-premise","content":" Overview: Running an application on-premise referred to a typical server (VM) hosted through OCIO and managed by the NRIDS Infrastructure Team for general server management.

If the information you are using does not exist here please review other guideline pages and/or contact the architecture team. Partnership Agreement NRM teams that work within our Development and Digital Services (DDS) branch start with a partnership agreement to ensure alignment between NRIDS and the program area. NRM Digital Service Delivery Partnership Agreement Team Agreement Before starting development, or when new team members begin contributing, ensure everyone on the team has the same understanding about coding practices, technology choices, and roles within your team. This is typically done during sprint 0. Coding Patterns and Practices Development Standards Familiarize yourself with the. These are requirements of all NRM applications. Data Guides, Standards and Resources Data is the enduring asset as part of any digital service in Government. Below are some recommended resources to get teams familiar with the data ecosystem within BC Government: Open Data Policy increases government transparency and accountability through the public release of information, including data. BC Data Catalogue is a resource for discovering thousands of datasets from across Government, and in some cases gaining access to the services themselves. Core Metadata Standard defines the metadata elements that help make digital information easier to find, to improve services, and increase government's efficiency Gender and Sex Data Standard improves how government collects and uses data to serve B.C.'s diverse population. Indigenous Languages Technology Standard: the BC Government is committed to including Indigenous languages in government records, systems and services. The BC Sans font is an open-source &quot;living&quot; typeface developed for government to improve the readability and delivery of digital services. It was designed to support special characters and syllabics found in Indigenous Languages in B.C. When designing and building your product, ensure it has the ability to collect, store, manage and display BC Sans characters. Connect with your architects for more details and references. Working with Data is a developer focused guide around developing data solutions within BC Government. Product Lifecycle Is your team replacing, re-architecting or re-platforming an existing application? If so, it's the Product Owner's responsibility to ensure the existing application is retired and the data is transitioned or preserved to ensure data quality, accuracy and currency as well as overall portfolio sustainability. Product Owners may reach out to their assigned Ministry Portfolio Manager (MPM) for assistance with the Application Retirement process. Ensure you allocate time and budget in your backlog to manage the overall lifecycle of the business processes, data and associated products. Helpful links on Application Retirement: Hosting Options and Additional Information See: Source Code Repository Source code should be stored in a GitHub repository in the &quot;bcgov&quot; organization. Private repositories can be requested in the bcgov-c organization NRM specific guidance on Github is here: Source Code Repositories Authentication and Identity Most NRM digital products leverage the OCIO SSO service that is backed by Keycloak. https://bcgov.github.io/sso-requests https://oidc.gov.bc.ca/auth/ Secrets Management The platform services team operates a Vault service. It is described here: https://beta-docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/vault-secrets-management-service/ Access to the service is here: https://vault.developer.gov.bc.ca/ui/vault/auth?with=token Security and Privacy It's important that teams engage with the NRM Security and Privacy teams early and often. They can support you with general advice as well as Security Threat Risk Assessments (STRA's) and Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA's). NRM Security Knowledge Base: NRM Information Security Home NRM Privacy Knowledge Base: NRM Privacy Knowledge Base OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is another great reference for security best practices for development teams: https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/migrated_content CI/CD The deployment pipeline is a key component for your application. For visibility, collaboration and maintainability modern teams are moving away from Jenkins towards GitHub actions. It is strongly recommended that code be submitted using a Pull Request. Automated testing can and should replace manual UAT wherever practical. NRM has a modern CI/CD template using GitHub Actions and HELM: OpenShift QuickStart targeted for OpenShift Silver or Gold Cluster. NRM has a modern CI/CD template using GitHub Actions, HELM and Argo: OpenShift QuickStart Emerald targeted for OpenShift Emerald Cluster. Application Programming Interfaces (API's) We recommend adopting an &quot;API First&quot; philosophy for application development, where teams both build and consume their API's. Providing API specification with proper metadata is mandatory irrespective of the underlying implementation(REST, graphql, grpc etc..) Along with API first approach the Architecture team highly recommends looking at Domain Driven Design(DDD) where each micro-service API is bounded by its business domain(https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) Also look at Event-Driven Architecture (Event Sourcing and CQRS) when building micro-services as it promotes highly decoupled APIS, communicating over an event streaming platform (https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html, https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html) We recommend a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach to API development, as it makes the application code more reliable and efficient along with easier maintenance in the future. There are several ways to name test methods/functions but we recommend using the pattern test&lt;method_name&gt;_&lt;given_condition&gt;_&lt;expected_behavior&gt;, it makes the tests more readable, predictable and becomes living documentation of the codebase. BC Government has published a set of API Guidelines here: https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Data-and-APIs/BC-Government-API-Guidelines Information on the corporate API gateway can be found here: https://bcgov.github.io/aps-infra-platform/ Database and Data Design Most of the teams working on OpenShift are choosing a flavor of PostgreSQL to persist data for their application. Some points of consideration are: What type of data are you persisting as part of your application? Are you storing geospatial data? Audio and/or video?What are your preferred integration patterns?Do you have any requirements, for example, to replicate data to the BC Geographic Warehouse (BCGW)?What are the requirements for consistency, availability and partitioning? For NRM guidance specific to data and database design, please visit this space: NRM Data and Database Development Guidelines Database backups can be setup using the backup container image; information can be found here: https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Backup-Container Document Storage BC Government has an on premise object storage solution that delivers low cost storage for unstructured and semi-structured data. The service is billed monthly to the highwatermark of the storage your team consumes in their S3 bucket at $0.07/GB/Month. To get an S3 object storage bucket, contact the Optimize team. COMS (Common Object Management Service) is an emerging common component that leverages the object storage solution. The advantage of this component is that it includes the ability to tag and add metadata, and integrates with BC Government's standard identity providers (IDIR, BCeID). To learn more, attend the Common Services Showcase team sprint reviews or contact the team via email. An emerging companion to the Common Object Management Service being built by the Common Services team is BCBox, which is a hosted solution that uses the COMS API to allow users to upload, tag and share files using any OIDC compliant authentication mechanism. The code repository for BCBox can be found here. Design Guidance General resources for Agile designers at Digital Government (BC Visual Identity, Official BC Design System, Web Style Guide, Content Design Guidance, UX Research Guidance, Service Design Playbook) can be found here: https://digital.gov.bc.ca/resources#:~:text=Read%20the%20playbook-,For%20Designers,-B.C.%20Visual Additional design system guidance: https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Design-System/About-the-Design-System BC Parks has extended their Design Guide to include the use of the BC Sans font and other additions specific to their program: https://bcgov.github.io/bcparks/design-guides Front End Frameworks Many agile teams are using a flavor of Javascript framework for their front end development (Angular, Vue, React etc). We recommend you pick the framework that works best for the team, and if you are developing a suite of applications for your program area, harmonize across the suite where that makes sense. This will minimize risk associated with changes to the team and enable other developers to work with your code. Web Mapping Frameworks A comparison of web mapping frameworks in use in BC Government can found here: https://bcgov.github.io/bcwebmaps-options/ Back End Languages Similar to front end frameworks, we recommend you choose a development language that best suits the team and the business challenge you are working on. If you are developing a suite of applications for your program area, harmonize across the suite where that makes sense. This will minimize risk associated with changes to the team and enable other developers to work with your code. There are many languages in use by agile teams across government, the most popular being Go, Python, Java, Javascript and Typescript. The Technology Radar is a great reference to see where the momentum is around languages and frameworks.

Do I need my application and data architecture to be formally approved? A. No, there is no formal approval process for your architecture. We recommend collaborating with the architecture team during any architectural spikes or any significant architectural decisions. Our collective experience and connectedness across the community can typically provide value for the team. Q. Do I have to use OpenShift to host my application? A. No. We would generally like new applications to be running in a containerized or serverless hosting architecture. OpenShift is a strong option for teams starting out given the maturity of the platform and the surrounding community, as is the AWS Public Cloud Service, both operated by BC Government teams. Following cloud native design principles will help ensure that your application workload is portable between hosting platforms. Q. Can I pass my application off to an ops team so the team can work on new apps? A. We generally follow the &quot;you build it, you run it&quot; philosophy, and therefore recommend you build a sustainment plan into your application roadmap. Adhering as closely as possible to the 12 Factor principles is a great way to promote a sustainable, cloud native build.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Languages Supported","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/nr-architecture-patterns-library/pr-preview/pr-100/docs/Coding Patterns & Practices","content":"Status GreenPublished Overview The purpose of this page is to outline some coding practices when developing an application. Practices used by a team should be documented in the repository. Languages Supported Currently, These 4 languages are the supported languages for use within the NRM. (Typescript/JavaScript, Java On Native, Python, R) Note regarding R: R can be a great fit for certain use cases such as statistical analysis, data visualization, data manipulation, and building Shiny apps. R is widely used in academic research and projects that focus on statistical modeling. However, R has limitations when scaling for application development, specifically for use cases when importing additional libraries is required. For application development (outside of shiny) and other use cases we recommend using one of the other support languages. As well Python can generally be a good alternative for those familiar with R. Native Deployments Some Languages are interpreted by their runtime ex:(java on JVM, python, javascript, etc..) whereas some languages are compiled (Golang, Rust). Use native(static binary) deployments wherever available. for ex: it is a MUST for teams using Java to deploy using GraalVM native image without the overhead of JVM interpreter. Focus on the scale-out vs scale-up as deployments are into containers or serverless. Code Design Patterns and Principles Apply SOLID and DRY principles. (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solid-principles-explained-in-plain-english, https://www.baeldung.com/cs/dry-software-design-principle)Use Composition over inheritance as much as possible.Use IOC(Inversion of Control) pattern for dependency Injection, following constructor-based injection over setter or field-based injection.The Service Layer should contain all the business logic of the application, and wrap each atomic transaction in the proper transaction boundary, Use transactions for read-only methods as well for ex: GET endpoints. (controller/endpoints → service → repository/active record → entity/query/mutation)The controller should call the service or multiple services inside a transaction boundary to perform the atomic operation.The Service Layer MUST have a transactional context. Use Lazy Loading and Cascading in ORM to avoid fetching child entities unnecessarily and also make sure the mutations are cascaded as well.Follow the TDD approach and the unit tests become living documentation of code, Stub external services with some sort of code, ex in java :- wiremock or powermock, split test lifecycles, so that UTs and Integration Tests can run independently.Follow The Twelve-Factor App standards -https://12factor.net/Use testcontainers(https://www.testcontainers.org/) or GHA services(https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-containerized-services/about-service-containers) for integration TESTS which includes, databases, queues, cache etc... Folder Structure and Naming Conventions Establish and understand your folder structure, if using a template avoid reorganizing (eg. https://github.com/bcgov/quickstart-openshift)Have a common consistent way when creating names. (eg. for your controllers - The naming of controller APIs should be in line with the pattern of tag definition in swagger - Swagger Tag resource-subresource - URN resource/subresource/pathParameter/subresource) Secret and Environment Variable Handling Exercise the practice of least privilege (eg. Who can and should be able to access secrets)Do not put sensitive information in the code, use a secretUse environment variables when they may not be sensitive but change between environments (eg. Dev, Test, Prod)Do not create secrets manually in Openshift. Secure APIs APIs should always be secured. This is generally achieved by using role based access based off their role validated via JWT.The exception to this would be public APIs. Error Handling Gracefully handle errorsUse plain language when reporting an error. (example. If an error requires a user to do an action they should be able to follow the direction from the error)Avoid generic language (eg. Error, review logs) Code Formatters and Plugins Use common plugins and common formatters across team members to avoid flagging code as changed when it was just the format that was changed. (eg. Prettier, SQL Formatter, ESLint)Share the IDE specific formatter in the GitHub to avoid conflicts Infrastructure as Code Keep in mind what happens when things go wrong, and how we recover. Maintain your infrastructure as code where possible. If it's not possible ensure you have sufficient documentation to stand back up your infrastructure. Pipeline Align your CI/CD pipeline with your hosting environment (GitHub Actions for Openshift Silver/Gold, GitHub Actions with ArgoCD for Openshift Emerald, GiHub Actions with Terraform for AWS) Understand your DevOps pipeline (eg. What happens when I create a PR, merge a PR, how an image gets built, how code get tested)Maintain your pipeline and align if possible to common practice (eg. https://github.com/bcgov/quickstart-openshift) The below was created using the QuickStart OpenShift as a reference. Please refer to the repo for the most up to date information. trueBranching Strategyfalseautotoptrue10111 GitHub PRs - Commits Follow the Conventional Commits for a better understanding -https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ PR Review and Practices PR titles should follow conventional commit (eg. https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).Branches should also follow a similar pattern (eg. feat/$featurename)A single PR should be for a single Feature/bug/hotfix/patch/etc and kept as small as possible and reasonableAdd appropriate labels established by your team. (eg. Adding labels to also indicate the applications being impacted by the PR, for instance, &quot;web&quot; or &quot;API&quot;)Connect the issue using the button &quot;Connect Issue&quot;, if not available install the Chrome ExtensionZenHub for GitHubor similar (this will help trace a completed task to the code modified)If you are the author of the PR avoid resolving the comments, instead reply to them to let the reviewer be aware of your thoughts.If you are a reviewer try to mark the comments as resolved to help the PR author to identify easily what is still missing.Comments and conversations on the PR are good to let everyone be aware of what is happening but a quick call can also save a lot of time.Once a review is raised, a reviewer should do the best effort to try to find a good moment to start. (eg. in the next 3 business hours. It does not mean finishing it in the 3 hours, just try to start providing some feedback. If multiple PRs are open at the same time the delays will be completely acceptable)Review according to best practices for the code and application. PRs are about code review (not people review)Have a merging practice. (eg. Squash the commits before merging to keep the main timeline clean)Clean up your branches (eg. Delete the branch after the merge is done (after mergingdo not reuse the branch)) Dependency Management It is strongly recommended to keep dependencies updated with automated pull requests from tools like Renovate, Snyk or Dependabot.This introduces new features, fix bugs, address vulnerabilities or improve performance, affecting the quality, security, and functionality of a project.Regular dependency pull requests help to keep changes small, up to date and, of course, manageable.These pull requests should not be closed without careful consideration. Unmerged updates should be written into an issue with reasoning and details to follow up in future. API framework evaluation factors The below outlines a fewkeyconsiderations which would help in the decision-making of language/framework to use for API development forcontainerizedenvironments. Details around API Design are outlined here(https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Data-and-APIs/BC-Government-API-Guidelines). The below points are on top of the guidelines provided in the link. Developer friendly, community support and libraries.Resource Consumption(memory/CPU) the less the better, supports the move towards green computing.Automated Open API 3 Specification generation, Swagger UI.Automated DB schema management (flyway/Liquibase or something similar).ORM integration for Database, ACID, Transaction support, Nested Transactions, Advanced Query with pagination, filter, sorting support.Supports TDD(Test Driven Development) out of the box, which supports unit and integration testing.Easiness of testing for pipelines and other automation.Easiness of OAUTH2 integration.Easiness of Circuit breaker integration and Resiliency.API versioning.Support for REST, GraphQL and gRPCAsynchronous REST Client.API Health checks(for liveness/readiness checks in Kubernetes world) out of the box which includes checking DB Connections and Message Broker connection (If present).Easiness of writing to log files in different formats.Switching Between Relational Database should be config only.Easy Concurrency.Easiness of Integration with Distributed tracing frameworks.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Patterns & Guidance","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/nr-architecture-patterns-library/pr-preview/pr-100/docs/intro","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Welcome to the Architecture Patterns And Guidance Docs Section.​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Patterns & Guidance","url":"/nr-architecture-patterns-library/pr-preview/pr-100/docs/intro#welcome-to-the-architecture-patterns-and-guidance-docs-section","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"The pattern library is sourced from confluence, some of the links are internal to confluence which is IDIR protected.

TL;DR - mono initially, multi with growth (e.g. +services, micro-service, APIs)In a mono repo approach, all services and codebase are kept in a single repositoryGenerally speaking, mono repos minimize dependency managementIf you have multiple services sharing the same libraries or common code, you may want to opt for a mono repo architectureIf you predict that your project will be extremely large or complex, a mono repo approach may become untenable over timeIf you have a large team with multi developers doing commits and triggering builds a mono repo approach may not suit your needsIf your project is being worked on by multiple teams (e.g. back end &amp; front end teams) you may want to opt for a multi repo architectureIf a versioning strategy is important to your project and you want to version services independently, a multi repo approach might be a better fitIf you have more than one team working in multiple repos for your project, developing patterns and best practices within your teams might be importantUptime is easier to maintain with a mult-repo approachMulti-repo allows for individual parts to be fixed/updated without taking down the serviceComplex projects and supporting architecture (pipelines, APIs, DBs) are easier to manage with multi repoImplementation (mono, multi, APIs, auth) matters far more than how the repositories are arranged  Source Code Repository License &amp; Ownership ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Removing Sensitive Data from a GitHub Repo, How To#","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/nr-architecture-patterns-library/pr-preview/pr-100/docs/GitHub Repository Best Practices","content":"Status GreenPublished Overview The purpose of this page is to outline practices when using GitHub as your source code repository Removing Sensitive Data from a GitHub Repo, How To# https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository Please make sure to follow those instructions carefully, as simply deleting the content will not remove it completely from the repository commit history.
