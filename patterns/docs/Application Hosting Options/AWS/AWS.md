Hosting Options
===============

When developing a custom application on the AWS Platform, we recommend 1 of 2 baseline architectures. Containers over RDS, or Serverless (lambda) over NoSQL (DynamoDB).

For containers over RDS, QSOS has been adapted be deployed on AWS. _Note: This is still a work in progress._

For serverless, there is currently no quickstart.

_Note: The same principals apply when using the quickstart, we do not recommend deviating away from the baseline technologies in the repo._

OpenShift QuickStart Application
================================

Our friends and collaborators in Forestry Digital Services and the Architecture team have created an application template that includes pluggable API backends (Node/Nest, Python/FastAPI, Go/Fiber, Java/Quarkus) and frontend (React, Vite), with a deployment pipeline to the OpenShift platform with an option to include a managed database.Â  This is a great resource to get product teams up and running.
