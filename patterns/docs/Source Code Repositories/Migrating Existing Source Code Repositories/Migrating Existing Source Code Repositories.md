Advantages to having code in the open:
======================================

*   Lower cost
*   Community visibility and collaboration
*   Encourages good development practices
*   Github has a suite of extra tools (such as GitHub actions)
*   Aligns with the [Digital Code of Practice](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/policies-standards/dcop/)
*   Aligns with the [BCGov Digital Principles](https://github.com/bcgov/digital-principles) - Working in the Open, Take an Ecosystem Approach
*   An extensive number of tests and tools are only free for open source projects

General Principles:
===================

*   Code (like data) should take an "Open by Default" position and closed by exception
*   The de-facto standard public code repository platform is Github
*   On exception, the private code repository platform is Github Enterprise

Under what circumstances should a code repository be Private?
=============================================================

*   There are algorithms in the code that would bring harm to individuals, industry or the Province
*   Information is hidden with intent, likeÂ state data from ArgoCD deployments
*   The presense of secrets, passwords, personal information or other sensitive data
    *   Please be aware that we provide resources and assistance in preventing this situation
